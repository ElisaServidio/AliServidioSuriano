\section{Implementation Plan}

In order to choose which component will be implemented first, there are two main approaches:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Bottom-Up
    \item Top-Down 
\end{itemize}
The approach that has been chosen for this task, and also for the Integration and Testing, it the first one, Bottom-up.
This approach permits to performs testing and integration in parallel with the implementation in a quite easy way: when a component is implemented, programmers perform Unit testing immediately, and as the system grows through the Integration testing it is checked that the different modules interacts correctly. When the entire system is completed, using this incremental process, System testing is performed, that will ensure that every requirement has been satisfied.
The main disadvantage of this strategy is that it is not possible to release a "early version" of the product, however this issue is compensated by a higher execution speed that the Bottom-Up approach ensures.
