\subsection{ID code for policy maker and agronomist from external database}
DREAM application implies the interaction with two particular kinds of user: the policy maker, an institutional figure, and the agronomist, a professional figure. Agronomists and policy makers must be authorized through a personal and unique ID code to be able to exploit DREAM's functionalities according to their role. \\

It is assumed that those unique id codes are created by Telangana Government and stored persistently in one of its databases accessible from the application only thanks to the external API TelanganaGovernmentService.\\

This means that DREAM has only the permission to visualize the data in the external database to check that the entered id codes are correct, but it has no permission to modify or update or delete it.
