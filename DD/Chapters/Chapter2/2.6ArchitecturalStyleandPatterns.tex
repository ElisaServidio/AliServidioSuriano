\section{Selected Architectural Style and Patterns}
This section clarifies the architectural style and architectural pattern adopted in the design of the DREAM system.
The main difference between the two is that an architectural style is the application design at the highest level of abstraction, it is a name given to a recurrent architectural design; while an architectural pattern is a way to implement an architectural style, it is a way to solve a recurring architectural problem related to it.
