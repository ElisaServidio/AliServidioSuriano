\chapter{Architectural Design}

In this chapter are reported the main architectural design choices from a high level point of view. In the following sections are presented the chosen paradigm of the system and its components, followed by the description of how the system will be deployed. Moreover, componentsâ€™ sequence and interface  diagrams are listed to describe the way components interact to accomplish specific tasks of the application. Eventually, the last two sections provide specifications regarding the selected architectural style and other design choices.
