\subsubsection{Regulatory policies}
Access to confidential and sensitive data must be restricted to protect it from being lost or compromised in order to avoid adversely impacting users. At the same time, users must be able to access data as required for them to work effectively.\\ All sensitive data and user information are acquired by the company under the accepted terms and conditions. Telephone numbers and email addresses won't be used for commercial uses.

\subsubsection{Hardware limitations}
The system requires a compatible device (smartphone or personal computer) with Internet connection to work properly. 

\subsubsection{Interfaces to other applications}
The system relies on various external services to retrieve, compute and validate data needed for DREAM to work properly.

\subsubsection{Parallel operations}
Users of DREAM must be able to access database at the same time, therefore parallel operations must be granted in order to avoid collision or any other integrity issue.
