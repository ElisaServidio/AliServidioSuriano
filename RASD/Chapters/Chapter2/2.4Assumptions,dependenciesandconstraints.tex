\section{Assumptions, dependencies and constraints}

This subsection of the RASD lists each of the factors that affect the requirements stated in \textit{Chapter 3}.\\

An assumption is something that is believed to be true and which is outside of the project teamâ€™s control. Unlike constraints, which put restrictions on DREAM, assumptions open possibilities for it and make its successful completion possible.
Eventually, dependencies refer to technology components, applications, and servers on which DREAM relies in order to be functional.
