\chapter{Introduction}

The Requirement Analysis and Specification Document (RASD) has the purpose of describing, to a wide range of potential readers, the system to be developed for the problem under consideration.\\ 
It contains the description of the scenarios, the corresponding use cases and the models describing requirements and specifications.\\
It focuses also on interactions between the system and the users, including the implied  constraints and functionalities that are going to be implemented.\\

The drafting of this document aims to follow the assignment which was proposed by the Software Engineering course of the Politecnico di Milano and to satisfy the required points of analysis. 
The project comes from an initiative presented by UNDP India, a United Nations division and within the Healthsites initiative.
