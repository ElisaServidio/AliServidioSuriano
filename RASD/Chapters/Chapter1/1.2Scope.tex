\section{Scope}

The goal of the DREAM software product is to develop and adopt anticipatory governance models for food systems while strengthening data-driven state policy.\\
It takes care of the acquisition and management of all data collected in order to support the work of farmers, agronomists and policy makers.\\
The system aims to collect data not only from sensors located throughout the territory, but also from farmers. The analysis of the acquired data aims to improve the production of farmers.\\ Bad-performing farmers are identified by policy makers and helped by the best-performing ones.\\
Everything is supervised by agronomists who take care of their own geographical areas of competence.\\

To better understand all the phenomena involved, we distinguish them into two types according to the "World and Machine paradigm" [M. Jackson and P. Zane]. The World is the environment surrounding the system, while the Machine is the system itself.
