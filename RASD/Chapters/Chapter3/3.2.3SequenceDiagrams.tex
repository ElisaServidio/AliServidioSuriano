\subsection{Sequence Diagrams}

The following UML sequence diagrams depict the objects involved in the main use cases previously described and the sequence of interactions between them and the system needed to carry out their functionalities.\\

In order to ensure greater understanding of what could be a complete real sequence of interactions among user and system, not necessarily correlated use cases have been taken under consideration while building the corresponding sequence diagrams.\\
In particular, the discussion forum sequence diagram implies a farmer searching for a topic (UC.11) and if he/she cannot find any thread already existing, he/she opens a new thread (UC.12). Moreover, as shown in the daily plan sequence diagram, an agronomist visualizes (UC.14) and then he/she updates (UC.15) the daily plan.\\
The mentioned use cases belonging to the corresponding sequence diagram are not necessarily related as previously pointed out, however connecting them allows a complete depiction of related product functions (discussion forum and daily plan).
