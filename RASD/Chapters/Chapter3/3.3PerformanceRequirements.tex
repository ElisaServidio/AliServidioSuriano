\section{Performance Requirements}

In order to evaluate the performance of the DREAM system it is necessary to specify that DREAM must maintain a response time of 1 second at most to allow all users to seamlessly interact with the application when needed. Data obtained from external resources such as connections to external databases must also have adequate response times, less than 2 seconds.\\
The system should be capable of supporting 250'000 users (workload).\\
Partitioning techniques and replicated databases are used to make the system scalable.\\
