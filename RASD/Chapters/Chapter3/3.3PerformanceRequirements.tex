\section{Performance Requirements}

In order to evaluate the performance of DREAM system it is necessary to specify that DREAM must maintain a response time of 1 second at most to allow all users to seamlessly interact with the application when needed. Data obtained from external resources such as connections to external databases must also have adequate response times, less than 2 seconds.\\
The system should be capable of supporting 250'000 users (workload). In fact, considering all 288 mandal of Telangana, 400 farmers per mandal, 269 working day per year and 3 visits maximum per day for each agronomist, it results 115200 farmers and 288 agronomist. The number of policy makers using the application cannot be exactly defined, therefore the most reasonable amount of users has been chosen.\\
Partitioning techniques and replicated databases are used to make the system scalable.
