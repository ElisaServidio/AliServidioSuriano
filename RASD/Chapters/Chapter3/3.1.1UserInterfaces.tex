\subsection{User Interfaces}
DREAM contains two main interfaces: mobile application and webapp interface.
In both interfaces, all three actors can perform the same operations.
However, it should be noted that certain features are more comfortable to use only from a certain interface.
The following mockups will give a more detailed description in terms of interfaces.
