\subsection{Portability}

Portability refers to the ease with which software that was created to run on one platform can be modified to run on a different platform. It is achieved by minimizing platform dependencies in software, isolating dependencies in well-identified locations, and writing the software to run on a "virtual machine" (such as a Java Virtual Machine) that encapsulates all platform dependencies across the board.
