\chapter{Overall Description}

This chapter contains a general description of the system from a high level point of view. \\
It describes the general factors that affect the product and its requirements. It does not state specific requirements. Instead, it provides them a background, which is useful to define them in detail in \textit{Chapter 3}.\\
Starting from scenarios and domain models, it proceeds with an analysis of product functions and users' most relevant needs in order to define assumptions, dependencies and constraints of the entire application system.
