\subsection{Software Interfaces}

The system relies on various external services accessible through API to compute and retrieve near-real time data:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Maps Service} to retrieve the position (latitude and longitude) of farms' address inserted by farmers
    \item \textit{Copernicus Climate Data Store Service} to retrieve data regarding soil moisture
    \item \textit{Telangana Government Service} to retrieve weather forecasts
    \item \textit{Telangana Water Irrigation System Service} to retrieve the amount of water consumed by each farmer
\end{itemize}
It also accesses ID codesâ€™ DB managed by Telangana government to check validity of ID code inserted by policy makers and agronomist while registering into DREAM.
